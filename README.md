# Cake AI
A demo project for system architecture desing and development

The purpose of project is just to show some approach for system design, development and give some examples.

Cake AI is an abstract system for baking cakes by artificial intelligence. It's provided to users by a sales web application in which customers can order some cake for their own idea based on a prompt.

# Mind map
Let's consider the overall considerations and ideas first.

```

# Use cases

Now, let's make some user scenarios possible in the application.

```mermaid
%%{
  init: {
    "flowchart": {
      "htmlLabels": false
    }
  }
}%%

# System context

Let's see what is in the system context - an abstract view on all parts.

In a little deeper layer we can see one of systems - Ordering System in more detailed view.
